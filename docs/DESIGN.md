# Design Rationale #

Currently, the implementation exists somewhere between three things:

 - A direct implementation from the [original Cairo whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1063.pdf)
 - A port of [Lambda Class'](https://lambdaclass.com) [Rust implementation](https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-vm)
 - A port of the [original reference implementation in Python](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang)
